Was he married? Who is his son’s mother? Meet his parents, siblings, his baby’s mother/wife, and more in this article.</p><p>This article covers it all.</p><h3><strong>CJ Harris Cause Of Death</strong></h3><p>Former “American Idol” semifinalist CJ Harris, who competed in Season 13, passed away abruptly at the age of 31. According to insiders speaking to TMZ, the pop artist reportedly suffered a heart attack (the official cause of his death is yet to reveal) on Sunday.</p><p>He was rushed to the Walker Baptist Medical Center in his hometown of Jasper,&nbsp;<span data-track-module=internal-body-link><a id=mol-a34e01c0-95ae-11ed-978e-0591c652badf href=# rel=noopener>Alabama</a></span>. According to a TMZ report from Monday, the crooner, whose real name is Curtis “CJ” Harris, was declared dead shortly after entering the emergency hospital.</p><p>CJ famously electrified the audience during his audition for Fox’s talent competition in 2014 by belting out the Allman Brothers Band’s popular song Soulshine.</p><p>Judge Keith Urban told the aspiring vocalist: “You sing because you have to sing, not ’cause you want to sing.”</p><p>“And I mean that in the deepest way,” the country star added. “And that’s why it’s so believable and real.”</p><p>On the program, the singer also sang renditions of “Too Close,” “American Woman,” and “Free Fallin.” In the semifinals, Harris was chosen as a wild card because she did not receive enough votes. He advanced all the way to the Top 6 before losing. In particular, Harris performed at the Grand Ole Opry with Darius Rucker, whom he credited as influencing his approach, after his “Idol” run.</p><p>Harris’ fellow Idol contestant Jessica Meuse sent a touching tribute to him.</p><p>‘Your talent and smile will be missed, and the world is definitely a darker and eerily quieter place without you in it,’ she wrote. ‘I’ll miss your random phone calls asking for life advice and talking about the music world… There are a lot of things I realize I will never understand — you leaving us so soon is one of those things.’</p><h3><strong>CJ Harris Career</strong></h3><p>CJ Harris had previously disclosed his humble upbringing. He began studying the guitar on a broken one his grandfather gave him when he was eight years old. Even though it just had three strings, that was enough to hook him on music. He also picked up the piano and sang in the church choir.</p><p>John Mayer, Keith Urban, and John Legend were a few of his musical influences. He released an album named Small Town Boy as an independent musician before appearing on American Idol.</p><p>“Happy New Years! New music coming soon!,” CJ’s most recent FB post from New Year’s day where he teased new music.</p><p>After his appearance on “American Idol,” Harris continued to work toward his goal. On his social media sites, the singer-songwriter continued to frequently post videos of himself singing and writing songs.</p><p>On January 13, 2023, the musician posted images from the 2022 Frog Level in Fayette, Alabama. His most recent singing Instagram post showed him singing along to The Fray’s “How to Save a Life” while also playing the guitar and harmonica. In 2022, on December 27, it was uploaded.</p><p>During his tenure on American Idol, CJ released several tracks. During his time on American Idol, his performances of Invisible, If It Hadn’t Been for Love, Soulshine, Free Fallin’, Gravity, and American Woman were all made available as non-album singles. His debut single In Love was released in 2019.</p><h3><strong>Did CJ Harris Leave Behind A Wife?</strong></h3><p>According to CJ Harris’s Facebook, he was single at the time of his death.

But, they are no longer in a relationship. Jordan went to Walker High School. Holli is working as a scale operator at Eco Material Technologies since November 2022.</p><p>Back in 2014, CJ was rumored to be dating Jessica Meuse, an American performer from Slapout, Alabama. One fan also enquired via tweet <a href=#>if Jess and CJ were together</a>.</p><p>She plays multiple instruments and has dazzled audiences since she was 10 years old (guitar, piano, and classical violin). Jessica won the Stars of Alabama statewide artist competition when she was 20. She then earned a spot on Season 3 of NBC’s The Voice, where she participated in the Vans Warped Tour and advanced to the blind auditions.</p><p>Jessica was then chosen for Season 13 of American Idol by the show’s judges, Keith Urban, Jennifer Lopez, and Harry Connick, Jr., where she progressed to become a Top 4 National Finalist. She also joined the Idols LIVE Tour, singing in more than 40 locations throughout the USA and Canada, and made history by becoming the first contestant in Idol history to sing a song of her own creation during the finals.</p><p>Meuse’s first single, Thank God It Didn’t Work was a Top 100 Mediabase Country Song at terrestrial radio and her second single, “Love Her Better,” is currently being promoted to country outlets around the country. The song’s music video has been honored with awards at seven different film festivals.</p><p>After the news of his death, Jessica&nbsp;condoled his demise, writing, “I’m completely shocked.
