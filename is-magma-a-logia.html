The Navy HQ Fleet Admiral. His real name is Sakazuki. A power user who ate the Mag-Mag Fruit, he can turn his entire body into magma.<h2>Is light better than magma?</h2>If you're trying to cover the enemy with AOE and burn damage, then Magma is the best fruit for you.

As part of the Devil Fruit's powers, the user can also split their body apart by themselves without the need of being chopped up by others in the first place.<h2>Are all smile fruits Zoan?</h2>Due to the faulty chemicals used to make them, only one out of every ten SMILE fruits will successfully grant Zoan-like abilities.<h2>Is the Gum Gum fruit a Zoan?</h2>The Gum-Gum Fruit , also known as Human -Human Fruit Type - Sun God Nika (ゴムゴム実, Gomu Gomu Mi) is a Zoan-type Cursed Fruit that turns the user's body into rubber, making the user a Rubber Human (ゴム人間, Gomu Ningen).<h2>Is mythical Zoan rarer than Logia?</h2>Its powers are ferocious, as it grants the user the ability to transform into any other person, replicating their entire appearance in the process.

Artificial Zoan - Artificially created Zoan Fruits that cause the user to permanently take on an animal characteristic; though, much more rarely, the user would be able to transform at will.<h2>Why can't DF users swim?</h2>bc not only do devil fruit users lose their ability to swim, they lose all of their strength in water (higher than at least their waist) deeming swimming impossible anyway. They do know how to swim. But they can't. They lose all their energy, thus become incapable of swimming.<h2>What happens if a Devil Fruit user eat another Devil Fruit?</h2>The concept is that once a devil's spirit is already within a person, it will not welcome another devil spirit. There would be an internal conflict so to speak and the person who consumed two devil fruits would inevitably die.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZKaZl6Kubq2MpaagoZE%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jerry-dixon-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jerry Dixon Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a>
