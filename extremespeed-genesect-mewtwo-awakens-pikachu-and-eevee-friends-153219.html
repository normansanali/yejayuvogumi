That was my point to begin with. They have no reason to act like such pansies in this regard when you take that into account.<p>Are you implying it's a travesty to write about Mewtwo, maybe even Gelardan or Mi, but somehow it's <i>not</i> disrespecting Shudo when they do it with Rocket Gang?</p><p>To hype up the new movie and help shift Mewtwo merch.</p>It still confuses them! How does that disprove my point?<p>This whole "talking down on the minds of children" shenanigans in the Pokemon fandom is getting pretty sickening. As a person who has to take care of his siblings <i>and sometimes others</i> on a day-to-day basis, I'm confident when I say <i>children are smarter than you think they are</i>. When *I* was five, I questioned the plotholes in this show. Pretty sure Japanese kids are capable of being picking this stuff up too and being confused about it.</p><p>The average viewers of the show would have started watching the series during <i>Diamond & Pearl</i>. They would not have seen that clip of Mewtwo.</p>Are you implying that parents did not buy the movie sets for their children? Did sales of that bomb?<p>There's nothing ambiguous about it - this isn't Shudo's Mewtwo and nothing in the movie came close to retconning its existence.</p><br>Was the 「おまえは」 (<i>omae wa</i>) ambigious or not? Make up your minds.<p>How many people and Pokémon has Ash said he'd come back for or meet again, but never did? Too many to count.</p>And those instances weren't cool either. That's like saying "oh, that guy right here shat in someone's food, you should defecate in her's."<p>Especially here, where we have an i<i>conic character</i> that everyone was dying to see again, had the perfect set-up from its previous character arc to take part in the premise of the movie, and had a trailer that tricked everyone thinking it was the original charater until the voice came around. That's hype BACKLASH on *themselves*.</p><p>It's a kid's show</p>Ugh. This excuse again.<p>"<i>It's a show for adults. They don't have to do anything but make gratuitous sex scenes.</i>"</p><p>Have you ever watched Don Bluth's children's movies? Or Bruce Timm's DC cartoons, <i>aimed at the same audience as this show</i>? Just because they're children doesn't mean they have to be exposed to everything shallow in the world. That's insulting to the children.</p><p>- they don't need to come up with a gripping backstory.</p>If they were too lazy to make a unique backstory for her other than making one that's an empty rehash of the old Mewtwo's story, <i>then why not just use the old Mewtwo</i> to begin with? They wouldn't have to explain anything in that case.<p>This movie <i>contradicts with its own prologue</i>!</p><p>(now, <i>Batman and Robin</i> was campy).</p>Tangent: I meant to say Batman and Robin. My bad.<p>Also, having something that reminds us of the original Mewtwo does hit a tone the anime seems to go going for at this point, with the recent Butterfree episode and such.</p>Except it's completely different. Satoshi's Butterfree was directly referenced in that episode, whereas the original Mewtwo <i>wasn't referenced at all</i>. How is it intruding on the territory of Shudo's Mewtwo? It was never specified that <i>only</i> Team Rocket were interested in cloning Mew or that an attempt to clone was <i>only</i> made once.<p>Except that it was never specified that <i>only</i> Team Rocket were interested in cloning Mew.</p>That has nothing to do with what I said.<p>Mewtwo isn't a simple clone of Mew. If it was <i>it'd be a Mew</i>. NO ONE, not even the movie director or screenplay writers, has come up with a viable explanation as to how or why a second Mewtwo, who looks exactly like the one that Dr. Fuji's team made, came into existence. It's always 'poof magic".</p><p>"Stop referencing this special as if the movie audience have watched it, or even know it exists. For the most part, they don't. They're aware of the first movie only."</p>How is assuming they haven't watched it <i>any better</i> than assuming that they did?<p>Oh right, because they're new fans and they're stoopid. Going with the logical in-universe choice? Bah.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHymxNOrnKado6WyprCMoJynnaOasLV5zJ6ura%2BfYq64rcqepaxloJ64oq%2FHrmSappRisqbCxJ5kn6qZmrulv41qbGxqYW58sa3GnmRu</p></div><div id=links><a href=./american-idol-contestants-you-may-not-know-died.html>&#171;&nbsp;American Idol Contestants You May Not Know Died</a>
