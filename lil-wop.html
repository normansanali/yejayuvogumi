Furthermore, he is well-known for his other tracks such as “Broadway,” “BackWoods,” and “Safe House,” as well as being Gucci Mane’s ‘protégé’ and signing a record deal with Mane’s 1017 Eskimo Label.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Lil_Wop_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Lil Wop? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>According to insiders, the 24-year-old rapper’s <strong>net worth</strong> as of 2022 is expected to be approximately $450,000, amassed by his music career rich in mixtapes, which has certainly enabled his extravagant lifestyle, which supposedly includes spending $4,000 monthly on drugs.</p><h2><span id=Lil_Wop-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Lil Wop- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Lil Wop, whose actual name is unknown, was born on October 17, 1995, under the zodiac sign of Libra in Chicago, Illinois, USA, and is of African-American ethnicity in addition to being of American nationality. Danny C. Williams is his father, a former musician best known as a member of the Detroit music group “Rick, Ran, and Dan.” Lil Wop has an older sister, Brandi, who was the R&B vocalist of the hip hop female group “Blaque” (known as “Blaque Ivory” in the rest of the world), and a younger sister, Kodie, who is also a rapper and composer and is better known as Kodie Shane.</p><p>He is also a cousin of Famous Dex, another American rapper. It’s no surprise that H has had a successful music career, coming from a family with such a strong musical pedigree.</p><h2><span id=Lil_Wop-_Professional_Career>Lil Wop- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Lil Wop debuted in the music industry in 2014, at the age of 19, when he began posting mixtapes and tracks to the famous music streaming service SoundCloud. Singles such as “Perky’s & Molly’s,” “Hyped Out,” and “The Wopster” were among his early works (hence one of his stage names).</p><p>In the years thereafter, he has collaborated with his sister and promising young rapper Trippie Redd, with whom he has recorded three more songs: “Beast Mode,” “Awakening My Inner Beast,” and “Rock the World Trippie.”</p><p>Lil Wop signed with Bases Loaded Records after releasing “Wopster The Mixtape” in December 2016. His debut studio-recorded mixtape, “Wopavelli,” hit the charts in March 2017, and barely a month later, he released another mixtape, “Wake N Bake,” hosted by DJ Holiday, which spawned multiple popular tracks, including “Gotcha Bitch” and “BackWoods.”</p><p>With his reputation on the rise, Lil Wop released “Wopavelli 2,” his second major and, at the time, biggest mixtape, in June 2017. It included ManMan Savage and Red Smash as special guests and spawned smash hits such as “Safe House,” “Dead People,” “Broadway,” and “Lost My Mind.” Lil Wop ‘caught an ear’ of his idol and one of the finest rappers in modern hip hop – Gucci Mane – and became his protégé, signing a record deal with 1017 Eskimo Label, as the latter earned a tremendous dosage of good evaluations from the audience,’ scoring’ nearly 2.8 million views on YouTube.</p><p>In October 2017, Lil Wop reunited with Trippie Redd for the second time, and the duo produced a collaboration EP named “Angels & Demons.” Later the same month, his third mixtape, “Wopavelli 3,” was released, with 17 songs, including the singles “Workstar,” “Friday the 13th,” and “Paid In Full,” which included Gucci Mane as a guest star. Lil Wop was chosen the “2017 Trapper of the Year” for all of his efforts and because of the massive amount of recognition he gained virtually overnight.</p><p>In August 2018, Lil Wop released “Silent Hill,” a horror-movie-inspired 10-track EP that spawned smash hits such as “The Ring,” “Hills Has Eyes,” and “Bride of Chucky,” with JDA Mook and Big Adolf as guest stars. After a two-month delay, he released his fourth Wopavelli series mixtape, simply titled “Wopavelli 4” in October 2018 — the 19 songs featured some previously released hit singles such as “Real Or Fake”, “Ghoul”, and “Hugh Hefner”. His most recent single, “The Slime,” was released in March 2019.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Existence>Personal Existence</span></h2><p>Despite his moniker or possibly how it was humorously formed.</p><p>Lil Wop, along with Trippie Redd, was arrested in October 2018 for his involvement in a street battle with Atlanta artist FDM Grady.<br>Wop and Redd got into a fistfight with Grady after allegedly insulting his girlfriend, which was followed by him waving a gun at them, and were subsequently arrested, facing accusations of criminal trespass and public fighting.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Lil Wop stands 6ft 5ins (1.96m) tall and has tattoos ‘from head to toe’ on his body. His signature beauty features include a ’24 carat grin,’ a sword tattoo crossing his right eye, and a replica of Gucci Mane’s renowned ice cream cone tattoo on his right cheek.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Notyourgothgirlfriend</a>, <a href=#>Medukarabu</a>, and <a href=#>Lili Sixx</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Rapper</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Nittdagritt</a></h3>Nittdagritt estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
