fact, <a href=#>she's now his fiance</a>. Whether <a href=#>he's rocking a "dad bod" </a>or he's showing off his ripped abs in a Calvin Kelin spread, Liam is seen as one of the hottest commodities in the entertainment business. So it makes sense that he's got himself a woman that is equally as lusted after. While many of Liam's fans wish that he would sweep them off their feet and treat them to a life of luxury, Maya likely didn't feel that way. Sure, she probably wanted to be on the arm of such a handsome and talented man, but the money wasn't a big deal for her. That's because Maya has always come from insane wealth... Seriously, her family is just loaded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Liam's net worth is valued at $60 million, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Wealthy Gorilla</a>, Maya has made quite an impressive amount from her modeling career and has been given even more from her outlandishly wealthy father. Here's the truth about Maya Henry's net worth, her spending, and why some fans think she and Liam live a lavish and somewhat ostentatious lifestyle...</p><h2 id=maya-henry-39-s-outlandishly-lavish-lifestyle-before-liam>Maya Henry's Outlandishly Lavish Lifestyle Before Liam</h2><p>On her 15th birthday, Maya Henry was gifted a whopping $6 million by her rich father. Recently, she was given a $4 million engagement ring by Liam and in between she has made about $10 million of her own money, according to Meaww.com. Maya was able to do this because of her growing modeling career under Elite. Additionally, she earns tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars per sponsored Instagram post due to her immense following. But it's been a lot easier for Maya to make the big bucks due to the wealth she started off with. As they say, it's easy to make money when you have it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her father, personal-injury lawyer Thomas J. Henry is no stranger to gifting his two children insane amounts of cash. According to Famous People Today.com, Thomas is worth $60 million, the same as Maya's musician boyfriend. Thomas' string of legal practices is the main source of his income. He has personally reaped the benefits of some of his practices' biggest lawsuit wins and he's not afraid to share that wealth with his family.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Details About Liam Payne's Relationship With Maya Henry And Their Break Up</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thomas' now ex-wife, Azteca, came to Texas from Mexico with her family. While the lineage of her family's wealth isn't public, it's safe to say that she's outlandishly wealthy as well. Of course, she's been awarded quite a few million after their 2019 divorce. But prior to that, the couple seemingly lived a happy life with their two kids, Maya and Thomas Jr., as well as Azteca's mom. All of whom were stars of a very short-lived reality show, "Hangin' With Los Henrys". The basis of the show was not dissimilar to any other reality show, but it did follow the family's journey to top Maya's Quinceañera (15th birthday party in Mexican culture) by throwing their son an even more lavish 18th birthday party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Liam Payne Fans Band Together To Show Support After Singer's Emotional Instagram Post</a></span></p><p>But back to Maya for a moment... Not only was she given the money straight up but the party itself cost about $6 million. While a Quinceañera tends to be a big day in Mexican culture, it's rare that it gets this kind of treatment that Maya's received. The event featured performances by Nick Jonas and Pitbull and took place in a 55,000 square-foot room in Texas. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Sun</a>, the event was planned by 150 people and was decorated with fountains and 30-foot cherry trees. An A-list photographer and an A-list make-up artist were even hired to make Maya look even more like a princess.</p><p>It sounds crazy. It looked crazy. But it happened.</p><p>As did her brother's over-the-top 18th birthday party where performers shot money into the crowd of his friends and he was gifted a $250,000 blue Ferrari 488 Spyder and a watch that was almost as expensive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Maya's dad hasn't just gifted his kid's lavish experiences, he has thrown himself crazy parties as well. His now ex-wife even helped plan his 56th birthday which cost $4.5 million, was attended by <a href=#>Cardi B</a>, and featured girls painted in gold dancing in cages hanging from the ceiling.</p><p>To be fair, Thomas has also been extremely philanthropic throughout his life and even inspired his daughter to start her very own charity, Maya's Corner, when she was 8. The charity provides school supplies to children in Texas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maya-39-s-lifestyle-with-liam>Maya's Lifestyle With Liam</h2><p>Maya's lifestyle now is as over-the-top as her life as a 15-year-old. Back then, her dad was throwing her major events and showering her with luxury. It's how she first met Liam, after all. She was just 15 and met him backstage at a One Direction concert. Although, they wouldn't reconnect until over three years later at a Dolce & Gobanna dinner in Lake Como. In between, she was featured in a Nick Jonas music video and even got a role in a small film. Now she's featured at every major fashion event in the world, repping companies like Vogue and Glamour.</p><p>Her Instagram account features numerous shots of her at the trendiest restaurants all around the world, visiting the most beautiful beaches, and showing off the insane home she has with Liam. Then there's all the nights she spends with her other rich friends, namely Brooklyn Beckham and his fiance, actor Nicola Peltz (another starlet from a massively wealthy family).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given how much money Liam has made in his music career, the success of Maya's modeling, and the impressive amount of money she comes from, there's likely no end to the crazy lifestyle she lives.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here’s Why Liam Payne Split From His Fiancé, Maya Henry</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6rbXApmSpmamjsrR5xaKYp5uVmnqurdiaZKGdnqfGbq3NnWShnaJiuqK%2F0qKtnmWemsFuw86rq6FlXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./valerie-mccaffrey-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Valerie McCaffrey Net Worth</a>
