Warm compresses are commonly used around the eyes and on sore muscles and joints. Warm compresses can be made using various methods, including dipping a towel cloth in warm water or heating stones.</span></p><p><span>The reason why warm compresses are said to work is that they are believed to help with inflammation. Inflammation can occur in many parts of the body, and using a warm compress can help deal with the symptoms. In the case of body muscles and joints, warm compresses are often used in conjunction with cold compresses (which are just the opposite of warm compresses) to further relieve inflammation.</span></p><p><span>Warm compresses are also believed to help with improving blood flow throughout the body. It is said that using warm compresses oxygenates tissues the blood better, which can, in turn, further improve muscle recovery. This is why warm compresses are often used on muscle injuries.</span></p><h3>The Benefits of Microwavable Heating Pads</h3><h4><strong>They’re easy to prepare</strong></h4><p><span>There are plenty of heating pads on the market, and you can heat them up in different ways - for example, some heating pads are heated by plugging them into a wall socket. While there are pros and cons to each approach, microwavable heat pads are arguably the most convenient. This is because compared to other heating pads, you can have it heat up with little to no hassle.</span></p><p><span>Microwaves have changed the way we prepare food. If it’s microwavable, then the food doesn’t need much supervision, and all you need to do is set a timer and wait. It allows you to do other things in the meantime. The convenience of the microwave also applies to microwavable heat pads, since you can take full advantage of the appliance’s ease of use.</span></p><p><span>Instead of heating up some water or finding a socket to plug the pad in, you can simply chuck that pad in and you’re already halfway there. Since the pads are designed to be microwaved, they’re completely safe inside, and you can prepare your medicines, make your bed, or do other things while waiting.</span></p><h4><strong>They have designs to cater to specific needs</strong></h4><p><span>Heating pads have evolved from the traditional rectangular designs of old. These days, there are heating pads designed for specific parts of the body, whereas other pad designs are made to improve their overall usability. Let’s take a look at both of these aspects in slightly bigger detail.</span></p><p><span>If you’re the type of person who constantly deals with muscle sores or pains in a particular part of your body, then you may want to look for a pad that’s designed specifically for that body part. Chances are that many other people experience pains in that same area and that there’s a product to cater to your need. So if you've got a lower back problem, which is one of the more common muscle pains, you can easily find a lower back heating pad.</span></p><p><span>Then there are heating pads made to be easy to use. Usability is important when it comes to heating pads as it helps those who are trying to treat themselves. If someone else is taking care of you, it doesn’t really matter what type of heating pad you’re using, but if you’re in pain while treating yourself, usability becomes a concern.</span></p><p><span>Heating pads with improved usability include those with pockets and handles or straps. These pads are easy to hold by yourself and you don’t need a cloth or some other item to hold them in place.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Tips When Using a Heating Compress</h3><h4><strong>Alternate with cold compresses</strong></h4><p><span>If you’re using a heating pad, chances are that you’ve sprained a muscle. This is pretty normal in physical accidents, and it can be quite annoying to deal with due to the pain. Heating pads and heating compresses do help relieve the pain, but they are only half of the treatment. If you really want to heal the inflamed muscle or joint quickly, consider using the pad with a cold compress, too.</span></p><p><span>The cold compress primarily offers relief to the inflamed area, and you’re supposed to alternate the use of cold compresses with warm compresses or heating pads. You don’t need to do this very often, but as long as you alternate between warm and cold, you can expect some results.</span></p><h4><strong>Take medications in tandem</strong></h4><p><span>There’s a common yet not completely obvious misconception that you can heal a sprain, cramp, or any other muscle pain with just compresses. And while that is possible, the recovery period would end up taking far longer than necessary. With simple medications, you can speed up the recovery process, helping you get back into shape more quickly.</span></p><p><span>When getting the right medications for your system, always consult your doctor. Take the medications as prescribed, and use your heating pads as necessary. Though you don’t necessarily need them, medications are vital if you want to heal up as soon as possible.</span></p><h3>How Much Do Microwave Heating Pads Cost?</h3><p><span>Typically, you can expect to spend anywhere between $10 and $20 on a decent microwavable heating pad. There are plenty of cheaper ones in the market, though they may not hold up to modern quality standards. There are also heating pads that cost more than $20, but you’re usually getting something else at that price point, such as an additional heating pad.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwvMSrqqimkaF6pK3RnmamoZOnvLit1Z5koZ2Rqbavs4ypmJ1n</p></div><div id=links><a href=./todays-jenna-bush-hagers-three-children-are-so-grown-up-in-coordinated-outfits-for-latest-family-snap.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jenna Bush Hager's three children are so grown up in coordinated outfits for latest family snap</a>
