Her father was an artist, while her mother was a writer, which opened many career opportunities for McGowan. At a young age, she became a child model thanks to her father's connections.

She has appeared in several shows and films and has also won an award for Best Debut Performance. But after gaining wider recognition in Charmed, McGowan fell off the map. It turns out Hollywood didn't drop the actress; instead, fans took issue with her.</p><h2 id=rose-mcgowan-has-had-a-controversial-past>Rose McGowan Has Had A Controversial Past</h2><p>Since rising to fame in the early 1990s, Rose McGowan has found herself in some controversial feuds with other celebrities. <a href=#>One of McGowan's most notable feuds is with one of her Charmed co-stars</a>, Milano.</p><p>The two became divided over time over their seemingly opposing political views, which were showcased when McGowan critiqued both Milano and the Democratic party.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She also claimed that Milano made the atmosphere on the set of Charmed 'Toxic AF'</a> in a cryptic Twitter post, where the two were seen publicly squabbling with one another over their personal and political beliefs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alongside this ongoing feud, <a href=#>McGowan has also previously 'fired shots' at Oprah publicly</a>.</p><p>On Twitter, she wrote the following statement: "I am glad more are seeing the ugly truth of @Oprah. I wish she were real, but she isn’t. From being pals with Weinstein to abandoning & destroying Russell Simmon’s victims, she is about supporting a sick power structure for personal gain, she is as fake as they come."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Rose McGowan Says She Doesn't 'Vote For Rapists' When Asked To Support Joe Biden">Rose McGowan Says She Doesn't 'Vote For Rapists' When Asked To Support Joe Biden</a></span></p><p>While this understandably caused some controversy, there were also many fans who jumped to McGowan's support, chiming in to agree with her statement and echo similar sentiments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, despite the bold statement, Oprah never directly responded to the cryptic tweet, defusing any possible drama that could possibly ignite from the situation.</p><p>However, while fans have agreed with the controversial actress on occasion, it seems that many of her critical comments and statements over the years have slowly changed people's minds.</p><p>So, what exactly happened for such a thing to happen?</p><h2 id=some-fans-haven-39-t-been-happy-with-rose-39-s-attitude>Some Fans Haven't Been Happy With Rose's Attitude</h2><p>Alongside this feud, McGowan has also made a string of other controversial statements over the course of her career.</p><p>However, it was her comments regarding the Me Too Movement and women's rights that seemed to be the icing on the cake for many members of the public, further adding to her controversial reputation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar50025029.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An interview published by The Sunday Times saw McGowan make what some thought was a questionable statement, stating that 'Hollywood's battle against sexual assault in the entertainment industry is only skin-deep,' labeling the #MeToo movement as "bull-(expletive)".</p><p>The article also added that McGowan stated that she felt 'left out of the survivors' community and brunches', despite being one of the most 'outspoken members'.</p><p>She then proceeded to say: “I just think they’re [expletive]. They’re not champions. I just think they’re losers. I don’t like them.”</p><p>Of course, this caused many supporters of the cause to go into an uproar. However, the actress later defended herself by stating: "I never said #MeToo is a lie. Ever. I was talking about Hollywood and Time’s Up, not #MeToo."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet that wasn't the actress' only publicly controversial moment.

This has led to many fans, as earlier mentioned, believing that the actress is extremely hypocritical, as she was one of the main advocates for the #MeToo movement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is just one of the reasons why many of her supporters have begun to question her.
