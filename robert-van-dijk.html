Robert abandons his family when his elder son was just 12 years old. Up until now, the reason for leaving them has been a secret.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Career>Professional Career</span></h2><h4>Early career</h4><p>At the local team Foreholte, Robert van Dijk began his playing career as a talented sweeper who “roamed” about the back line. Moreover, he began playing futsal with friends on a team when he was 19 years old.</p><p>He made the sacrifice, which was well above what was anticipated because someone had to be the goalkeeper. In addition, he moved positions on the field and became the reserve goalkeeper for the club when van der Sar departed Foreholte for vv Noordwijk.</p><p>After one season, he was promoted to the first team. In the main team of Feyenoord, he made his goalkeeping debut just three years after switching positions on the field.</p><p>He took over for Dean Gorré in the 59th minute of Vitesse Arnhem’s (2-2) first-division match on December 5, 1992, after starting Ed de Goey was dismissed for a foul in the penalty area.</p><p>Two years after making his debut, he experienced his career peak when, on November 30, 1994, he took the place of an injured de Goey in a cup match against Willem II (which ended in a 1-1 draw), and went on to win Man of the Match awards following a penalty shootout.</p><p>He&nbsp;had one year left on his Eindhoven contract, but they mutually agreed that he may leave the team on a free transfer.</p><h4>Signed De Graafschap club</h4><p>He departed the team on July 9 and signed with De Graafschap. He signed a contract with De Graafschap for two years, but he missed most of the first year because of a knee injury.</p><p>It took him months to fully recover after the doctors found extensive cartilage wear. De Graafschap placed 17th overall and was demoted to the second division.</p><p>He later went back to RKC in the summer of 2005, where he established himself as the team’s starting midfielder and didn’t miss a game first season. His 2006–07 season was less beneficial, though, as Adrie Koster, the RKC Waalwijk coach, was fired on November 27, 2006, as a result of his team’s poor performance.</p><p>He was introduced as SC Heerenveen’s new reserve on January 30, 2007, after Brian Vandenbussche. He played in 15 first-division games during his two years with the team. At the age of 39, he returned to Feyenoord.</p><p>After making 18 league appearances, he announced his retirement from football at the end of the season. On August 9, 2011, it was revealed that the player had signed a one-year contract with FC Utrecht.</p><h4>Virgil van Dijk</h4><p>Before making his professional debut in May 2011 at another Dutch club, FC Groningen, Virgil Van Dijk started his youth career in 2009 at the academy of Dutch club Willem II.</p><p>In the UEFA Europa League Play-off game, he made his first appearance for the team and scored twice in a 5-1 win.</p><p>He got hurt during the campaign and was hospitalized for a while. He returned to the field for the team. In addition, he scored seven goals in 62 games across two seasons with the team. He agreed to a £2.6 million, four-year contract with the Scottish team Celtic in June of that year.</p><p>Moreover, he made his Scottish Premiership debut for the final 13 minutes as a substitute. He scored his first Celtic goals in a 4-1 victory over Ross County, one in each half. 2014 saw his team win the Scottish Premiership.</p><p>After losing to Inter Milan in the UEFA Champions League semifinals in 2015, Celtic was eliminated, but he still contributed to their second consecutive league championship.</p><h4>Joining a premier English club</h4><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-224704 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Virgil-van-Dijk-playing-for-Liverpool-FC.jpg alt="Robert van Dijk" width=650 height=902 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-224704 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Virgil van Dijk playing for Liverpool FC (Source: talkSPORT)</p><p>In 2016, Robert van Dijk agreed to a £13 million, five-year deal with Southampton of the Premier League. He also made his club debut against West Bromwich Albion.</p><p>In 2015–16, he was also recognized as Southampton’s Player of the Season. He was acquired by the English team Liverpool in January 2018 for a then-record-breaking £75 million for a central defender.</p><p>He faced Everton in his club debut. In his debut season, the team advanced to the 2018 UEFA Champions League final but fell to Real Madrid.</p><p>He was elected PFA Player of the Year on April 28, 2019, and on June 1, 2019, following Liverpool’s 2-0 win over Tottenham in the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final, he was chosen as UEFA’s final player of the game.</p><h4>International career</h4><p>Robert van Dijk made his full international debut for the Netherlands on October 10, 2015, in a 2-1 victory over Kazakhstan on the road in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match.</p><p>Manager Ronald Koeman named Virgil the Netherlands’ captain on March 22, 2018.
