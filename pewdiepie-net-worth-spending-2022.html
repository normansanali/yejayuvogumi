These days, however, things have changed in a big way. For example, there now are loads of <a href=#>massively famous “reality” stars</a>. Still, most “reality” stars owe their fame to television which is a traditional medium. On the other hand, the relatively recent rise of social media has allowed an all-new group of stars, YouTubers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Surprising Star Is The Highest-Earning YouTuber In 2021</a></span></p><p>As anyone familiar with the world of YouTubers will already know, several people have risen to fame due to the video-sharing social media network. In fact, <a href=#>many traditional stars have created YouTube channels</a> in an attempt to capitalize on the people who see that website as their main source of entertainment. Despite all of the people who’ve found success on YouTube, it is pretty clear that PewDiePie reigns supreme in that arena. As a result, PewDiePie has managed to accumulate an incredibly impressive fortune but the truth of the matter is that he could be a lot richer.</p><h2 id=pewdiepie-cashes-in-on-his-youtube-success>PewDiePie Cashes In On His YouTube Success</h2><p>All the way back in December of 2006, a young man named Felix Kjellberg registered his YouTube account. In the years since then, Felix has become best known by his adopted name, PewDiePie. During the early years of PewDiePie’s YouTube channel, he solely focused on uploading Let’s Play videos in which he played video games with his live commentary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Minecraft YouTuber Singlehandedly Sets Selena Gomez's Music Trending On Twitter By Saying It 'Slaps'</a></span></p><p>Since PewDiePie has an entertaining personality and an edgy sense of humor, he eventually attracted a huge fan following on YouTube. Additionally, PewDiePie owes a huge portion of his success to his ability to evolve his YouTube channel. After all, PewDiePie’s content transitioned away from Let’s Play videos over time. For example, PewDiePie’s content has included vlogs, music videos, comedy shorts, meme videos, and clips of him addressing the camera about a myriad of topics. Since PewDiePie posts a wide variety of videos that appeal to different people and fans love his personality, his YouTube channel has 111 million subscribers as of the time of this writing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the last several years, PewDiePie has repeatedly been named as the most subscribed YouTuber. While that is impressive enough, it is worth noting that the only channels that have surpassed PewDiePie are owned by major companies. Given PewDiePie’s massive popularity, a company called Maker Studios, which Disney owns. penned a deal to work with him. Throughout their partnership, Maker Studios helped PewDiePie get an app, a website, and an online merchandise store. On top of that, PewDiePie’s popularity allowed him the opportunity to create exclusive content for YouTube’s premium service.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Disney Bullied These Celebs During Contract Negotiations</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of the money he has made on YouTube, his other ventures, and all of the cash his partnership with Maker Studios afforded him, <a href=#>PewDiePie was able to become extremely rich</a>. In fact, according to celebritynetwoth.com, PewDiePie currently has a $40 million fortune.</p><h2 id=pewdiepie-rsquo-s-controversial-past-has-cost-him-millions>PewDiePie’s Controversial Past Has Cost Him Millions</h2><p>From the moment that PewDiePie created his YouTube channel, his edgy sense of humor was on full display when he regularly joked about taboo topics. With that in mind, it would be unreasonable for anyone to expect PewDiePie to suddenly have a PG personality once he gained a larger audience. After all, PewDiePie would have lost many of his followers if he became sanitized. Still, once PewDiePie became extremely famous, he should have known been prepared for a backlash if he didn’t change his ways at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January of 2017, PewDiePie sparked outrage online when he was on camera playing a video game and dropped the N-word in anger. Following an initial uproar and a sincere apology on PewDiePie’s behalf, he largely walked away from that scandal unscathed. However, PewDiePie’s next major scandal did huge damage to his career and made it harder for people to make money on YouTube.</p><p>On the website Fiverr, users can hire people to work for them either in-person or remotely. When PewDiePie figured out that Fiverr users could pay people to do just about anything, he decided to put out a video where he could “showcase how crazy the website was". Unfortunately, PewDiePie opted to pay two men to hold up a sign that read “Death to all Jews” on camera. Of course, it should go without saying that PewDiePie wasn’t actually calling for anyone to be harmed. However, The Wall Street Journal published an article showcasing the Fiverr incident, and other times PewdiePie has jokingly used anti-Semitic language and imagery in his videos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After attention was drawn to some of his past conduct, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Disney-owned company Maker Studios severed all ties with PewDiePie</a>. Furthermore, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube canceled the release of the second season of Scare PewDiePie</a>, a premium series they produced with Felix. Following YouTube shelving the series they made with PewDiePie, it was clear that any plans to make premium content with him in the future were over. Based on those facts alone, it is clear that PewDiePie missed out on making a lot of money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it was pointed out that several major companies had their products advertised on PewDiePie’s videos that arguably were offensive, things changed for YouTubers everywhere. After all, several companies threatened to stop advertising on YouTube. As a result, the people in charge of the social media network made changes which resulted in it being harder for anyone to make money on YouTube, PewDiePie included.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>19 Sketchy Things About PewDiePie Everyone Just Ignores</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinnq%2BUnrKxtcRmpZ6sXay8s8DHZqqpnZ6Ztq%2BzjGtna2pf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-unusual-link-between-a-lenni-lenape-chief-and-18th-century-new-york-politics.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Unusual Link Between A Lenni-Lenape Chief And 18th-Century New York Politics</a>
