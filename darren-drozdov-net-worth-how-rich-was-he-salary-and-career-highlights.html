Salary And Career Highlights</h1><div id=sub-header>August 2024 · 3 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>Darren Drozdov Net Worth</strong> has piqued the public’s curiosity. Discover how much money the former wrestler and football player collected throughout his career. Darren Drozdov was an American author, former football player, and wrestler. In all sports, he had a short but notable career.</p><p>He played in the CFL for the Saskatchewan Roughriders and the NFL for the Denver Broncos. He was also known for his ability to make himself vomit at command, giving him the nickname Puke. Unfortunately, the former WWE wrestler and NFL athlete is no longer with us. The WWE confirmed Drozdov’s death on Friday, recalling him as an intimidating presence in the ring.&nbsp;Darren died through natural causes, according to a statement released by his family. While numerous concerns surround his personal and professional life, many people are also curious about his net worth and income before death. Here’s what we know thus far.</p><h2>Darren Drozdov Salary, Net Worth Before Death, Career Earnings, and Achievement</h2><p><strong>Darren Drozdov’s net worth</strong> has been estimated to be between $1.2 million – $12 million by various web publications. However, no formal media outlets have released specific information on the essayist’s riches. As a result, the quantities listed above may not be correct or up to date. Although his income as a football player and wrestler is unclear, based on his contract, accomplishments, and sponsorships, he must have gotten a sizable compensation.</p><p>From 1993 to 1996, Darren was a professional NFL player for three seasons. He was a member of the New York Jets, the Philadelphia Eagles, and the Denver Broncos. NFL players received an average yearly pay of $600,000 to $700,000 from early 1990 to mid-1990.&nbsp;Darren started his wrestling career in the late 1990s after finishing his football career.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Darren-Drozdov-1.jpg alt="Darren Drozdov" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to Sportskeeda, the lowest WWE wrestler’s salary is $250,000, while the highest is $12 million. However, the late athlete competed in WWE in the late 1990s. Even at that time, he must have been well rewarded. In addition, the late athlete’s profession as a WWE writer and columnist must have paid well. Drozdov’s earnings over his career might have been more or lower than these averages.</p><h2>Darren Drozdov’s Career</h2><p><strong>Darren Drozdov,</strong> as previously stated, was an American football player and professional wrestler who had a brief but notable career in both sports.&nbsp;As a defensive lineman, he played for the NFL’s Denver Broncos and the CFL’s Saskatchewan Roughriders. The late athlete rose to prominence after vomiting on national television, earning him the moniker Puke. He eventually joined the World Wrestling Federation, where he was known in the ring as Droz or Puke.</p><p>Darren competed with wrestlers like D’Lo Brown, The Godfather, and The Headbanger as a part of the Legion of Doom stable. Unfortunately, a horrible accident ended his wrestling career, leaving him crippled from the neck down.&nbsp;During a WWF SmackDown! taping on October 5, 1999, the skillful wrestler sustained a terrible neck injury when D’Lo Brown executed a powerbomb on him and he fell on his head, breaking two vertebrae in his neck. The episode was never shown on television.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Darren-Drozdov-3.jpg alt="Darren Drozdov" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Despite his disability, Darren had an optimistic attitude and continued to work as a writer, essayist, and columnist for WWF. He also recovered some upper body and arm mobility.&nbsp;Darren Drozdov will be remembered as a brave and remarkable individual who personified the spirit of resilience and resolve in the face of hardship.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibmqqimrtusNGosZ2npmK7psCMsKarrJhitbDDjKugnKBdrK60eceeZKyZnJa%2FunnAp5tmm5Gnsqa%2BjKGgoKCcnrSpwNJo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dylan-gonzalez-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-187975-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dylan Gonzalez Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a>
