Her Marriage</strong></h4><p>As mentioned earlier, the casting director is married to the New Girl lead actor, Max Greenfield. They got engaged on their five-year dating anniversary and later got married in 2008. In addition to having a successful career, Tess Sanchez is also doing a great job of keeping her home together. Speaking about her in an interview with Elle, her husband revealed that she was in charge of running the household, describing her as the greatest director he has ever worked with. In running the home, Max said, she goes as far as writing a list of chores he must do and ensures that he does them.</p><p>Meanwhile, it is believed that Tess presence in Fox contributed to her husband landing his breakthrough role on the Fox sitcom&nbsp;<i>New Girl.&nbsp;</i>It was a double celebration for the couple as this happened around the same time she was promoted to EVP casting.</p><h4><strong>2. </strong><strong>Tess Sanchez’s </strong><strong>Children</strong><br></h4><p>The behind-the-scene strong force is currently a mother of two beautiful children. She gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Lilly, on January 27, 2010, and in April 2014, she confirmed that she was set to welcome another child. Finally, on August 24, 2015, her second child, a son named Ozzie James Greenfield was born.</p><h4><strong>3. What’s Her Net Worth?</strong></h4><p>Following her years of working in one of the major television networks in America, Tess Sanchez has no doubt made some good money but her net worth is currently not known. However, a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Employment and Wages revealed that as of 2011, casting directors received a median annual salary of $70,660. 10% of those directors who are at the bottom, the report said, made $32,010 on the average every year while those in the top 10% where Tess belongs, cashed in an excess of $187,000 every year.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Labor further disclosed that California (Sanchez city of residence) and New York are the two states that pay the highest amount to casting directors and this is because of the number of films that are produced in the states annually. Judging by the report, it is obvious that this casting director is well paid for her services.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyVqMBuv8CnmqGdqmKvqruMmp6eZZGjsW6vxKWcm2WWlrC1v4yamaitpGK6osSMoKmenZ6btqa4w6xksKGWmnw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./eric-tabach-christian-nilsson-unsubscribe-box-office-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Two Filmmakers Rented Out a Theater and Got the No. 1 Movie in America</a>
