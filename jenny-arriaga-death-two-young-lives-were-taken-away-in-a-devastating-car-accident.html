This man was so genuine and just wanted to see all his ppl win no matter what. He would always ask how my coaching stuff is going, how Shoot 360 stuff is going and was always so hype for me about anything good. Was always there about anything bad or tough. Just a true friend man. A true friend that I‚Äôll always be so grateful to have grown close to especially this past year. My man became one of ‚Äúthe boys‚Äù and was always down to hang out. We never had a dull moment , we was always laughing and always just on BS living life and having fun. I‚Äôm truly lucky to have crossed paths with Lezter man, and was lucky to be able to call him a friend. My heart and prayers go out to both families of Lezter and Jenny Arriaga and especially to my guy Robinson Juarez. Family and friends, please donate to their go fund me if you are able, to help take care of funeral expenses. Anything will help.

As we mourn her passing, we also celebrate her life, cherishing the memories and contributions she made during her short time with us. Her spirit will continue to live on, a testament to a life well-lived, albeit far too short.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkaq0qq3OrKZyZZKZe6aw1Getp2eamruvxYyaqauhkZyubrDEmquhZaSsvG7Fzq6loGWcnsOmv4ywnKudXamurLHNZpiwmalitq95wGabnq6RqMGiwMinnmabkad6oq%2FCopuepqRk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./leena-sayed-net-worth-163392.html>&#171;&nbsp;Leena Sayed Net Worth</a>
