He was so peaceful He said, ‘Yay!’ He had the purest and sweetest look on his face.”</p><p>On Facebook, Anastasia posted, “I am losing my honey beeps. I’m so sad and feel like this is carving a hole in my chest. He is COMPLETELY unresponsive. He is end-stage. Please give us peace at this time. Texting him or trying to call him needs to stop now, please.”</p><p>Anastasia also let his fans know that she has “beaten the odds for so long,” She added, “he is snuggled and loved by his girl constantly.
